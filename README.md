This is my space dedicated to SQL project.

<br>

In "SQL training" folder you find:
* [SQL training.pdf](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/SQL%20training.pdf) -> the presentation created for sharing knowledge about SQL;
* [database - query.sql](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database%20-%20query.sql) -> queries to create two tables with needed data to fulfill report;
* [database.md](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database.md) -> database as table view;
* [report - query.sql](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/report%20-%20query.sql) -> queries as answer for tasks in report;
* [report.pdf](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/report.pdf) -> full example of report with queries and screenshots.
