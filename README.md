This is the space dedicated to my SQL tasks

Inside "SQL training" folder you find:
* [SQL training.pdf](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/SQL%20training.pdf) -> the presentation created to sharing knowledge about SQL;
* [database - query.sql](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database%20-%20query.sql) -> queries to creating two tables with needed data to fulfill report;
* [database.md](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database.md) -> database as table view;
* [report - query.sql](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/report%20-%20query.sql) -> queries as answer for tasks in report;
