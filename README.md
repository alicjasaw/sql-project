## sql-project

This is the space dedicated to my SQL tasks

Inside "SQL training" folder you find:
* [SQL pdf](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/SQL%20training%20II.pdf) -> this is the presentation which I created and it helped me sharing knowledge about SQL;
* [database](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database.md) -> these are two tables (created by me) given data to create queries and fulfill report;
* [database - query to create](https://github.com/alicjasaw/sql-project/blob/main/SQL%20training/database%20-%20query%20to%20create.sql) -> these are queries create tables with data;
* [report]


Have fun!
